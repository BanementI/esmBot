A personal fork of esmBean that adds unfunny things and in-jokes.
This repo is for transparency for if I make this bot invitable for strangers.

## Usage
This bot is only for certain people. Currently, **I'm not open to giving invites**. You can invite the original esmBot here: https://projectlounge.pw/invite

A command list can be found [here](https://projectlounge.pw/esmBot/help.html) (excluding my edits).

If you want to self-host the bot, a guide can be found [here](https://github.com/esmBot/esmBot/wiki/Setup).

## Credits
Essem for making the funny bot.
