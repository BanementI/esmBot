![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/esmBot/esmBot.svg)

A personal fork of esmBean that adds unfunny things and in-jokes. 
This repo is for transparency for if I make this bot invitable for strangers.

## Usage
This bot is only for certain people. Currently, **I'm not open to giving invites**. You can invite the original esmBot here: https://projectlounge.pw/invite

A command list can be found [here](https://projectlounge.pw/esmBot/help.html) (excluding my edits).

If you want to self-host the bot, a guide can be found [here](https://github.com/esmBot/esmBot/wiki/Setup).

esmBean runs on 1GB of RAM, please be kind to it.

## Edits
- Prefix is [$] by default.
- messages.json is unfunnier.
- New command "ben" does the funny Talking Ben thing.
- Added distasteful things to the Reddit command
- LavaLink is NOT set up, so no VC commands work.

## Don't trust me?
Good! It's good practice to give Discord bots only the permissions they need. Bots like esmBot DO NOT need admin, so don't give it to them. Give the following permissions instead:
- Send messages
- Read messages
- Embed links
- Attach files
- Use external emoji

esmBean will ask for these anyway. Please don't give it admin.

## Credits
Essem for making the funny bot.
